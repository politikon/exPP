Using microdata from the "Barómetro CIS julio 2014" (available at www.cis.es - barómetros - depositados en el banco de datos)
I created a category for identifying those who voted to the PP back in 2011 (general election - November) but now are neither
willing to vote them again nor feeling identified with the party at all. I compare their ideological profile with the profile
of loyal supporters. So this is just a dofile to reproduce the analysis displayed in the following link:
